DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBamuc\fP is a light-weight Linux application for composing and playing music.
.br
It works like this:
.br
Tune fragments are entered graphically, combined into a complete
tune by means of a script file. Several instruments, mono-synthesizers
and percussive sounds are provided, as well as sampled sounds.
Tunes can be exported as WAV or MIDI files, or as human-readable scores
in postscript format. MIDI files can be imported.
.br
For the inexperienced composer there is help available with scales
and chords.
.SH
FILE
.PP
The file should be a 'score file' (extension: .sco) or a 'script file'
(extension: .scr). If a script file is read, also a score file with the

a score file is generated by Amuc.
